## Objective
Junior front-end developer

## Summary
Several years ago I decide to change my career. I have always been interested in computers and admired with a big variety of opportunities that IT gives to us. So, I started to learn programming. At first, I explored information about different programming languages and after that, I decided to learn Python. 
During the last year, I’ve finished Python training in the EPAM company. Also, I studied by myself with the help of books, videos, tutorials and articles from the Internet. 
Now I am studying in the RS School on the “JavaScript/Front-End” course. I’ve decided to go to this course because it is new experience and I have a goal to become full-stack developer in the future.
